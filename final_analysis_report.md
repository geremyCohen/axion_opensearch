# OpenSearch Performance Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

Analysis of OpenSearch benchmark data from `/results/optimization/20251006_193245/c4a-64/4k/nyc_taxis/` reveals performance characteristics for a single configuration: **70 clients, 16 nodes, 16 shards** with 2 repetitions.

## Key Findings

### Performance Metrics
- **Average Throughput**: 495,936 docs/s
- **Throughput per Node**: 30,996 docs/s/node  
- **P50 Latency**: 934ms
- **P90 Latency**: 2,785ms
- **P99 Latency**: 3,785ms
- **Error Rate**: 0.000%

### Repeatability Assessment
- **Throughput Variance**: 2.06% CV (Coefficient of Variation)
- **P99 Latency Variance**: 2.44% CV
- **Rep-to-Rep Difference**: 20,390 docs/s (4.1%)
- **Latency Difference**: 184.7ms (4.9%)

**Assessment**: Good repeatability with low variance between runs.

### Cluster Health During Benchmarks
- **CPU Usage**: ~1% average across all nodes
- **Memory Usage**: 92% used (247GB/270GB total)
- **Cluster Status**: Green throughout testing
- **Active Shards**: 35 total (3 primaries, 32 replicas)
- **Node Count**: 16 nodes active

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Performance Characteristics

The configuration achieved nearly 500K docs/s throughput with acceptable latency:
- P50 latency under 1 second indicates good median performance
- P99 latency of ~3.8 seconds shows some tail latency but within reasonable bounds
- Zero error rate demonstrates cluster stability under load

### 2. Resource Utilization

**Memory**: High memory usage (92%) suggests the cluster is memory-bound rather than CPU-bound. This is typical for indexing workloads where data buffering and caching consume significant memory.

**CPU**: Very low CPU utilization (1%) indicates substantial headroom for increased load.

### 3. Scaling Implications

Based on current data:
- **CPU headroom**: Significant opportunity to increase client load
- **Memory constraint**: High memory usage may limit further scaling
- **Network/IO**: Not directly measured but likely not bottlenecked given low CPU

## Recommendations

### Immediate Testing Priorities

1. **Increase Client Load**: Test 80, 90, 100+ clients to find saturation point
2. **Memory Optimization**: 
   - Reduce heap size from current high usage
   - Test with different JVM settings
   - Monitor GC behavior under higher loads

3. **Node Scaling Tests**:
   - Test with fewer nodes (8, 12) to assess efficiency gains
   - Test with more nodes (20, 24) to evaluate linear scaling
   - Maintain nodes=shards ratio for optimal distribution

### Configuration Optimization

1. **Shard Strategy**: Current 16 shards on 16 nodes provides good distribution
2. **Replica Strategy**: High replica count (10.7 avg) may be excessive for performance testing
3. **Memory Management**: Consider reducing replica count to free memory for indexing buffers

### Comprehensive Benchmarking Matrix

To enable proper scaling analysis, collect data for:

| Clients | Nodes | Shards | Repetitions | Priority |
|---------|-------|--------|-------------|----------|
| 60      | 16    | 16     | 3           | High     |
| 80      | 16    | 16     | 3           | High     |
| 90      | 16    | 16     | 3           | High     |
| 100     | 16    | 16     | 3           | High     |
| 70      | 12    | 12     | 3           | Medium   |
| 70      | 20    | 20     | 3           | Medium   |
| 70      | 24    | 24     | 3           | Medium   |

## Data Quality Assessment

- **Completeness**: Limited to single configuration
- **Reliability**: Good repeatability (CV < 5%)
- **Cluster Health**: Stable throughout testing
- **Metrics Coverage**: Comprehensive performance and health data available

## Limitations

1. **Single Configuration**: Cannot assess scaling patterns or optimal configurations
2. **Memory Pressure**: High memory usage may mask performance bottlenecks
3. **No Baseline**: Lack of comparison with different cluster sizes or configurations

## Next Steps

1. Execute comprehensive benchmarking matrix above
2. Monitor memory allocation and GC behavior during high-load tests  
3. Implement automated analysis pipeline for multi-configuration datasets
4. Consider testing with reduced replica counts to optimize for indexing performance
