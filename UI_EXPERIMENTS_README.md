## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Structure
All experiments use consistent data structures with the following key fields:
- `cluster`: Cluster identifier (c4a-64 64k, c4a-64 4k, c4-96 4k)
- `config`: Configuration string (clients_nodes-shards)
- `throughput`: Documents per second
- `latency`: P99 latency in milliseconds
- `efficiency`: Calculated as throughput/(latency/1000)
- `cv`: Coefficient of variation for consistency measurement
- `rep`: Individual repetition number

### Performance Calculations
- **Efficiency Score**: `throughput / (latency / 1000)`
- **Performance Bands**: 
  - Excellent: Efficiency ≥ 200
  - Good: Efficiency 150-199
  - Average: Efficiency 100-149
  - Poor: Efficiency < 100
- **Anomaly Detection**: Statistical outliers beyond 2 standard deviations
